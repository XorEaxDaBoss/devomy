## Scripture

Matthew 13:8: Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.

## Observation

This is an amazing idea that I've kind of gotten used to, I guess! Think about how things are growing here at work. This is like a story about God's words (like seeds) and people's feelings (like soil). If we plant the seeds in good soil, we're definitely going to get good results! And not just good, but really, really good results! The smallest result is 30 times what we put in! Now, I know it's hard to measure how much God's words affect our lives, but it's definitely way more than usual. No other thing we learn about, and no other book anywhere, will make our lives better like this. That's because the Bible is so much more than just words. There's one thing we have to do for this idea to work; there's something important we need to do. Our feelings need to be in a good place to accept these seeds. The better we feel, the better the results will be. 

## Application

Anything I read or study won't make my life better like the Bible. But the big thing is, my heart can't be tough. Seeds have to go into soil that's good and soft. To make sure that God's words will really help me, I need to make sure I'm preparing my heart. I need to fix any tough parts I find. The more I can make my heart open to God, the better the good outcome. While I can be happy that I'll get at least thirty times what I put in, I want to try to get a hundred times as much.

## Prayer

Lord, thank You for this special word. Your kindness is so big that every time I read Your Word, I see it. This word about good results happening in my life because of what Your words do in my heart, it's a great gift. Holy Spirit, assist me in preparing my heart. If I can't do it alone, help me soften my tough heart. I don't want to miss chances to receive Your blessings. I want my life to be just how You want it. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
