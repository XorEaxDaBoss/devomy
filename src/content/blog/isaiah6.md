## Scripture

  

Isaiah 6:6-7: Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.”

## Observation

When Isaiah witnessed the glory of the LORD filling the temple, he became distressed due to the impurity of his lips. Then, he observed the seraphim take hold of a burning coal. I can only imagine the fear and anxiety that Isaiah experienced as the angelic being approached him. However, his apprehensions were short-lived as God had a purpose for him. The burning coal served as a remedy for Isaiah's unclean lips in a ceremonial and symbolic manner, tailored exclusively for him. The redemption and cleansing we receive through Jesus' blood is generic in nature, as He died once for all and His sacrifice of love covers all sins. Nonetheless, God's redemption is unique to each individual's sins. He is aware of the needs of every person, knowing all our shortcomings and weaknesses. Despite these, He has plans to forgive our sins and remove our iniquities when we confess our sins to Him.
  


## Application

There are times when I am faced with the holiness of God, whether it's during a worship service, while reading my Bible, or when I'm in prayer. In those moments, I'm often reminded of my own shortcomings and sins. While there may only be a few specific sins that I struggle with, they can feel overwhelming when I'm confronted with how they compare to God's holiness. It can be a little scary at first, but I remind myself that Jesus didn't use a burning coal to cleanse me - He used the cross. The cross is my reminder that I am cleansed and forgiven. As it says in Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." Even though God knows the specific details of my iniquities, I don't have to be ashamed because He has offered me the remedy I need.


  

## Prayer

Lord, I am humbled by Your grace and mercy. Your love is truly beautiful because You see me for who I am, flaws and all, and yet You still choose to cleanse me. You have done this time and time again, and I am forever grateful to be Yours. Please let Your will be done in me. I pray that I will never be ashamed of needing Your redemption. In Jesus's name, Amen.
