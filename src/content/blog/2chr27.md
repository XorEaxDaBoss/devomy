## Scripture

  

2 Chronicles 27:6: Jotham grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the Lord his God.

## Observation

In this verse, we see a summary of King Jotham's reign in Judah. It is noted that Jotham became a powerful and successful king because he walked steadfastly before the Lord his God. Jotham's faithfulness and commitment to the Lord contributed to his success and prosperity as a ruler.
  


## Application

Jotham's steadfastness before the Lord highlights the importance of consistency and perseverance in our faith. It is not a one-time commitment, but a daily journey of remaining faithful to God's commands, seeking His will, and maintaining a close relationship with Him.


  

## Prayer

Lord, we pray for our leaders, both in the government and in various organizations. May they seek Your wisdom and lead with righteousness and integrity. May Your blessings be upon them as they govern and serve their people. Amen.
