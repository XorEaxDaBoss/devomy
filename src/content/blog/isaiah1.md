## Scripture

  

Isaiah 1:18: "Come now, let us settle the matter," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool."
  

## Observation

Having blind faith is actually a bit of a misnomer. God wants us to clearly see the benefits and advantages of following Him. From the earliest commands, He laid out options for His people (Deuteronomy 30:19), encouraging them to make rational and well-thought-out decisions. In Isaiah's opening chapter, God's people are reminded to carefully consider their choices â€” their devotion to Him versus their devotion to idolatry. God promises forgiveness of sins and prosperity for obedience (verse 19), but also warns of destruction for rebellion (verse 20).
  


## Application

It is important to carefully consider our choices and decisions. God's gift of forgiveness is paramount, and He promises to provide us with the best of the land if we remain faithful. However, turning away from God can lead to serious consequences. This verse reminds us that our faith is not blind, but rather grounded in reason. We must always remember that Jesus is the foundation of our faith. He washes us clean of our sins and is the God in whom we place our trust.


  

## Prayer

Lord, I thank You for reminding me that You are a God who presents us with choices. I am grateful for the opportunity to make an informed decision to follow You. I pray that You would help me use this experience as a tool for evangelism, and that You would remind me of the simplicity behind the reason for our faith. Thank You for the gift of forgiveness, and I ask that You would give me boldness to share these truths with others. In Jesus's name I pray. Amen.
