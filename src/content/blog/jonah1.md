## Scripture

Jonah 1:5: All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.

## Observation

This made me think of a story about Jesus calming a storm. In both stories, there was a sudden storm, people were in danger, and God was glorified in the end. The interesting thing is that in both stories, the person who knew the answer was sleeping peacefully. This tells us a lot about Jonah's faith - even though he was in danger, he believed so strongly in God's plan that he was able to sleep through the storm. Some people might say that he would rather die than let Nineveh be saved, but I don't think that's true. If you read the story closely, it's clear that he believed God would save him.  


## Application

How I act during a storm shows my faith. The foundation of my faith is my God's unchanging, powerful, truthful, and caring nature. Although I don't have a prophecy to fulfill, I and other believers claim promises, especially eternal life, through faith in Jesus Christ. Additionally, when I seek the LORD continually, He gives me individual promises that increase my hope until they come true and strengthen my faith in His faithfulness.


## Prayer

Lord, thank You for always being dependable and strong. You are my safe haven in every difficulty. With the help of the Holy Spirit, guide me back to Your protective tower whenever I face challenges. Help me to understand and remember all of Your promises for me, according to Your perfect plan. I pray this in Jesus's name. Amen.
