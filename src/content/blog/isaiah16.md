## Scripture

  

Isaiah 16:13-14: This is the word the LORD has already spoken concerning Moab. But now the LORD says: “Within three years, as a servant bound by contract would count them, Moab’s splendor and all her many people will be despised, and her survivors will be very few and feeble.”
  

## Observation

Isaiah made a prophecy regarding the downfall of Moab, and a postscript was added later to this paragraph. As with most prophetic writings, particularly those in the apocalyptic style, the timing was not clearly specified. However, Isaiah received a revelation that it would occur within three years. To avoid any confusion, Isaiah stated that these years should be counted like a hired worker would, which means an ordinary and standard year. Thus, the event would occur within three years, precisely as predicted.
  


## Application

When studying biblical prophecies, keeping a few things in mind is crucial. Firstly, most of the Old Testament prophecies have already taken place. Secondly, when reading apocalyptic prophecies, we must be careful not to set specific expectations for timelines. Even though some passages may provide a timeframe, it's not always as clear as Isaiah's prophecies, and interpretation is necessary. Lastly, the primary reason why prophets give prophecies is for God's glory when the predicted events come to pass. The timing of these events is of secondary importance. Therefore, when Jesus returns, His glory will be undeniable, and the truth of the Bible will be revealed. Our readiness for His return should be based on something other than the time between now and then. We should always be prepared for our Savior and remain ready.

  

## Prayer

Lord, I am grateful for Your patience, compassion, and loving kindness. Thank You for providing us with many warnings. However, I don't want to be overly concerned about future events that may or may not directly affect me. Instead, I am thankful for the warnings of the Holy Spirit within me, guiding me away from temptation and sin. Please continue to work righteousness in me and discipline me towards obedience, good works, faith, and love. May Your will be done and may You be glorified in my life. I pray this in Jesus's name. Amen.
