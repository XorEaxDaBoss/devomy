## Scripture

  

2 Chronicles 26:5: He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the Lord, God gave him success.
  

## Observation

In this passage, it is stated that Uzziah, the king of Judah, sought God during the days of Zechariah. Zechariah instructed him in the fear of God, guiding him in a reverent and obedient attitude towards the Lord. As long as Uzziah sought the Lord and remained faithful to Him, God granted him success in his endeavors.
  


## Application

The verse highlights the importance of ongoing seeking and maintaining a close relationship with God. Success was not a one-time event for Uzziah but a continuous result of his faithful seeking. It reminds us that we need to remain steadfast and dedicated in our pursuit of God, continuously seeking Him with all our hearts. Zechariah instructed Uzziah in the fear of God, teaching him reverence and respect for the Lord. The fear of God involves recognizing His holiness, authority, and power, and it leads to a lifestyle of obedience and devotion. Cultivating the fear of God in our lives enables us to align ourselves with His will and experience the blessings He has for us.


  

## Prayer

Lord, We pray for a deep hunger and thirst for Your presence. Stir within us a passionate desire to seek You earnestly and consistently. Grant us the discipline to prioritize our relationship with You, to spend time in prayer, to study Your Word diligently, and to listen attentively to Your voice. Amen.
