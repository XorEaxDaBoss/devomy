## Scripture


Jonah 4:11: But Nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city?
  

## Observation

God is speaking to Jonah, addressing his anger and frustration over the repentance of the people of Nineveh. God highlights the great number of people living in Nineveh, including those who are ignorant or innocent, symbolized by those who cannot tell their right hand from their left, as well as the abundance of cattle. God emphasizes His deep concern for the city and its inhabitants, revealing His compassionate nature and His desire for their redemption.
  


## Application

Jonah's response to God's compassion reveals his own lack of understanding and limited perspective. This verse challenges us to align our hearts with God's, embracing His love for the lost and His desire to see people come to repentance. It encourages us to set aside our personal preferences, biases, or feelings of superiority and to actively participate in God's redemptive mission for all humanity.



  

## Prayer

Lord, thank you for revealing Your compassionate nature through the story of Jonah. Open our hearts to understand the value of every life and to embrace Your love for all people. Help us see others as You see them, and grant us the boldness and compassion to share Your message of salvation. May we be instruments of Your grace and vessels of Your mercy, shining Your light in a world in need of Your love. Amen.
