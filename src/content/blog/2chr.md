## Scripture

  

2 Chronicles 25:2: He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not wholeheartedly.
  

## Observation

The passage describes the reign of Amaziah, the king of Judah. Amaziah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, indicating that he followed God's commands and sought to honor Him. However, the verse also points out that Amaziah's obedience was not wholehearted, suggesting that there were areas where his devotion and commitment to God were lacking.
  


## Application

 If we recognize areas of our lives where we have not been wholeheartedly obedient, it is important to repent and recommit ourselves to God. We can turn to Him in prayer, confess our shortcomings, and ask for His forgiveness and guidance. God is gracious and merciful, ready to restore us and help us walk in wholehearted devotion to Him.



  

## Prayer

Lord, we confess that there are times when our devotion and commitment to You may falter or become divided. We acknowledge that we have not always given You the fullness of our hearts and lives. Forgive us, Lord, for those moments when our obedience has been lacking. Fill us with Your Holy Spirit, Lord, that we may be transformed from within. Help us to love You with all our heart, soul, and mind. May our thoughts, actions, and words align with Your will, and may our lives be a reflection of Your grace, love, and truth. We trust that You will continue to work in us, shaping us into vessels that bring honor and glory to Your name. Amen.
