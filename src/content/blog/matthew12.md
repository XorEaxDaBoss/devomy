## Scripture

Matthew 12:25: Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, â€œEvery kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.

## Observation

Jesus is rejecting the notion that He is connected to evil. He's helping people get rid of evil spirits, so He can't be evil. This idea applies to other situations too. For example, it's not surprising that many couples argue on their way to church. Ministries also often break apart due to disagreements among leaders. The devil aims to break any strong bond, whether it's a marriage or a partnership in a ministry (or any good connection between believers).

## Application

If I continue to see my family as a kingdom, I must defend it just like I would a kingdom. Just like city walls are important, people inside being together matters too. A civil war inside is worse than battles outside. I can't afford to be divided with my loved ones. But that doesn't mean I always agree with them; I must stand for what's right. Still, I must know the devil wants division in my family. I must work hard to keep peace and togetherness. For now, the most important thing to protect is communication.

## Prayer

Lord, I know I need to protect the kingdom you gave me, but I can't do it all by myself. Please keep the kingdom safe in ways that are better than what I can do. Please fix the problems that have hurt our relationships. Holy Spirit, please help me understand what our experiences mean. Please show me how to serve your kingdom. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
