## Scripture

  

2 Kings 15:37: In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.
  

## Observation

In this chapter, we learn about the kings of Israel in Samaria. They were constantly betrayed and murdered by their servants and subjects, with the villains taking over the throne. This cycle repeated itself over and over again, with each new king being elected through murder and betrayal. Towards the end of the chapter, we see that Jotham succeeded his father in Judah. He tried to do right by the Lord, though he wasn't perfect. One interesting verse near the end of his paragraph caught my attention.
  
## Application

This chapter reminds me that God keeps his promises. David's descendants continued to rule over Judah until the end, including Jotham. The promises God made to me through King Jesus will definitely come true, not because I'm faithful, but because He is. This gives me a great confidence boost! However, Jotham experienced testing and discipline in his life. God allowed other kings to come against him as a test. Whether Jotham passed or failed, God's faithfulness as a Father cannot be missed. Likewise, even though I'm not perfect, God will allow tests in my life to draw me closer to Him. He wants me to pass these tests and have victory in my spiritual battles (as described in Ephesians 6).

## Prayer

Lord, thank You for always being faithful throughout history and my life. I am grateful for the promises I have in Jesus Christ because of Your faithfulness. Although I know my faithfulness to You is not always perfect, I desire to be disciplined and pass any tests You have in store for me. I am willing to face difficulties as long as it brings me closer to You. My determination, declaration, and devotion to You are unwavering. May Your will be done in my life. In Jesus's name, I pray. Amen.
