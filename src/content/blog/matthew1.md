## Scripture

Matthew 1:20–23: But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.” 
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God with us”).

## Observation

The passage underscores that these events surrounding Jesus' birth fulfill the prophecies of the Old Testament. In particular, it references Isaiah 7:14, where it was foretold that a virgin would conceive and give birth to a son called Immanuel, meaning "God with us." This prophetic fulfillment emphasizes the divine plan and purpose behind Jesus' birth.

## Application

As followers of Christ, we are called to prepare our hearts for His presence and work in our lives. We can do this through prayer, studying His Word, and cultivating a relationship with Him. We should also share the good news of Jesus with others, just as the genealogy prepares the way for Jesus' ministry. It reminds us of God's faithfulness throughout history. Just as He fulfilled His promises to Abraham and David, we can trust that God will remain faithful to His promises in our lives. Also the name "Immanuel," meaning "God with us," speaks of God's presence among His people. As believers, we can take comfort in the assurance that God is with us in every circumstance of life. We can rely on His presence, guidance, and strength, knowing that He will never leave us nor forsake us.

## Prayer

Lord, we pray for the faith to trust in your plan, even when it seems unconventional or challenging. Help us to rely on your wisdom and guidance, knowing that you have a perfect plan for our lives. Strengthen our trust in you, and grant us the peace and assurance that comes from surrendering to your will.
