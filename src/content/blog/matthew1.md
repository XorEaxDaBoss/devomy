## Scripture

Matthew 1:17:Â Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.

## Observation

The book of Matthew starts by telling the genealogy of Jesus, from Abraham to the Messiah. Then, the verse above sums it up while showing the pattern of generations between Abraham and Jesus Christ. Abraham was promised that his descendants would bless all the world's nations. Jesus Christ was the fulfillment of that promise.

## Application

The way God arranged the numbers in a pattern of 14+14+14 may have a deeper meaning, but I don't know. What I do see is that God's order is simple and beautiful. He is not a random God but has a purpose for everything. I may not understand why He does things the way He does, but I can appreciate the beauty of His ways.

## Prayer

Lord, your skills are truly remarkable. I may not fully understand why you chose fourteen generations between Abraham and David, then again from David to the Exile and from the Exile to Jesus. Still, I find it beautiful in its simplicity. I believe you have a well-organized plan for my life and know the perfect timing for the events ahead of me. If it is your will, please help me see and hear what is coming so that I may know my part in your plans. Until then, I will continue to worship and praise you for your mysterious ways. In Jesus's name, I pray. Amen.
