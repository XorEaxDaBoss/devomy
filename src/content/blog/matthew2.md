## Scripture

  

Matthew 2:19–23: After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.” So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.
  

## Observation

Joseph is warned in a dream to take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. After Herod's death, Joseph is instructed in a dream to return to Israel with Jesus and his family. Fearing Herod's son, Joseph settles in Nazareth, fulfilling the prophecy that Jesus would be called a Nazarene.

  

## Application

Joseph's obedience to the angel's instructions demonstrates his unwavering trust in God's guidance and protection. Similarly, we are called to trust in God's leading in our lives, even when faced with uncertainties or challenges. By seeking His wisdom through prayer and studying His Word, we can align our steps with His divine plan.



  

## Prayer

Lord, we pray for the strength and courage to trust in your guidance in every aspect of our lives. Help us to seek your wisdom through prayer and your Word, knowing that you have a perfect plan for us. May we be sensitive to your leading and willing to follow wherever you may lead us. We confess that fear can often hinder our obedience and faith. But we know that you are greater than any fear we may face. Help us to cast our fears upon you and to find refuge in your promises. Strengthen our faith, Lord, so that we may step out boldly in obedience to your calling, knowing that you are with us every step of the way. We recognize that your ways are higher than ours, and you may lead us along unexpected paths. Give us hearts that are open and willing to embrace the plans you have for us, even when they differ from our own. Grant us the grace to surrender our own agendas and to align ourselves with your greater purposes. Amen.
