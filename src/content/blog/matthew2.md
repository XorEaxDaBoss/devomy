## Scripture

  

Matthew 2:22â€“23: But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.

## Observation

Joseph was a very faithful man who heard from God in his dreams multiple times. God warned him to not break his engagement to Mary, to flee from Herod's plan to harm Jesus, and to go to Nazareth. Even though Joseph may not have realized it at the time, all of this was part of God's plan to fulfill prophecies about Jesus. Joseph was afraid to go back to Judea, but God warned him. He was just trying to protect Jesus and do what was best for him.
  

## Application

Sometimes being afraid can make us do things for God. When I feel scared, what should I do? Joseph had been told by God in his dreams twice before he got scared about going back to Judea. I think Joseph probably prayed when he was leaving Egypt. He knew God had given him his wife and stepson and kept them safe from Herod in Egypt. So when he got scared again, he turned to the Lord and hoped he would speak to him in a dream. I think God can still speak to us in dreams, but he may not do it as much as some people say he does. I know I have the Bible to help me know God's will and direction. When I get scared, I need to go back to what I know shows me who God is. No matter how I feel like the Holy Spirit is leading me, the Bible is the most important thing. God may have spoken to me in dreams, but I know he has spoken to me through his Word. When I get scared, I need to turn to the Bible.


## Prayer

Lord, You know everything, You are all-powerful, and You are always with us. You deserve all the praise for saving us. Sometimes, I get scared because I cannot see what's ahead. But I pray that whenever I feel afraid, I will remember Your holy words, which are always true. Please help me understand Your words and guide me through the Holy Spirit. May Your will be done. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
