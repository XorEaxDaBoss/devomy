## Scripture

Matthew 18:26-27: “At this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’ The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.

## Observation


This parable goes to verse 35. Jesus meant that if we're forgiven a lot, we must forgive others the same way. What got to me is how the Father is graceful, and how we react. Our sins make us owe God a lot. But we can't truly pay it back. We can do good stuff and sacrifices, but it doesn't fully erase the debt; it just calms God. Jesus lets God be fair and kind. We're like that servant in the verse. God knows we can't really pay, even over time. So, He forgives us. The problem is, we try to repay, which isn't right. God wants us true, not creating more debt. It's an insult to His grace to repay a debt He already wiped away.

## Application

My first reaction is to get Jesus' point. I've been forgiven for countless sins, so it's wrong to hold grudges against anyone, no matter how they hurt me. My mind might dwell on their big wrongs, but my heart should stick to mercy and forgiveness. I got mercy, so I should give it. Also, I should be thankful to God for His mercy. When I serve Him, it must come from worship, not trying to pay Him back.

## Prayer

Lord, I can't fully get how much mercy You give me. It's a lot. I get some, but help me get it all. Please show me all the times I got mercy, so I can give it to others easier and faster. I hope I never have to forgive something really bad. Keep my family safe. But if I do, remind me of this verse and Your compassion. I ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.
