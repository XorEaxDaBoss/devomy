## Scripture

Matthew 11:28-30: “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

## Observation

The main message of the gospel is important for being a good disciple. If you don't understand it well, you could end up leaving your faith. Jesus wants us to follow Him and do what's right, like being kind and giving to others, but those things can be hard. The Pharisees did them too, but without Jesus's help. The difference is that Jesus takes away our sins and gives us rest, and His way is easier and better. When we learn from Jesus, we don't have to carry the weight of our sins anymore.

## Application

If following Jesus feels like a burden, I know something is wrong. It's like I am trying to carry something heavy while still being weighed down by something else. I need to focus on the good news of Jesus every day. This will help me remember how much he loves me and how he saved me from my sins. When I focus on this, it becomes easier for me to follow him and do what he asks of me. Before, I was trapped in sin, but now I am free to live the life he wants for me.

## Prayer

Lord, this world distracts me from appreciating you. I get tempted to do wrong things, have family obligations, and work duties. I don't want to miss out on what Jesus offers me every day, which is rest and life. Sometimes, I forget about the light burden and yoke you have given me and pick up heavy loads and chains. Please forgive me for my sins and help me hear your call every day to take up my cross and follow you. I want your will to be done in my life. Thank you, God. Amen.
