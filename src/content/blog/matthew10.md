## Scripture

Matthew 10:26-28: â€œSo do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
  
## Observation

Jesus was talking to His close followers, whom He was sending out on a mission for the first time. He gave them a special assignment to spread the good news of the gospel, knowing that they were heading into unfamiliar territory. He understood that it wouldn't be easy for the early church, and they might feel scared. However, Jesus encouraged them to focus on His teachings rather than being afraid. He wanted them to remember how powerful and holy God is instead of being consumed by the world's dangers. When we compare this to the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14-30, we can see how important this message is to God and those who are entrusted with it.

## Application

Why is evangelizing sometimes difficult for me? It's not that I feel shy with everyone, but there are certain situations where I become hesitant to talk about my faith. Lately, I've been trying to push past my fears, but they still stay. I've realized that the solution isn't just to force myself not to be afraid or to become fearless instantly. Instead, I need to change my focus and what I fear. Like Jesus said, I should concentrate on what the Bible teaches (His words) and remember to have a fear for the LORD. When I do this, I won't be trying to persuade people forcefully; I'll simply be sharing His message. I won't be overly concerned about how people react, but I'll be joyful about how God responds to my efforts.

## Prayer

Lord, I appreciate the simplicity of Your gospel plan. Please remind me constantly that I don't have to be persuasive; all I need to do is share my testimony. I don't need to have all the answers; the Bible is enough. Help me retain and understand what I learn from You, Lord. Give me the courage to speak boldly about what I have learned and heard. Help me fully embrace the bold spirit You have placed within me so that I can proclaim Your message fearlessly. Strengthen my faith for Your holiness. Thank You for Your mercy and grace, Lord. May Your will be accomplished in my life. In Jesus's name, I pray. Amen.
