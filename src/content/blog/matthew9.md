## Scripture

Matthew 9:36-38: When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.”
  
## Observation

It's really sad to think about all the people who are struggling in the world. Thankfully, God and Jesus can help and give them a purpose. Even though lots of people have heard of Jesus, some don't really know who He is. Here in the Philippines, where Jesus is well-known, people can still misunderstand Him. It's hard to believe that there are still places where people have never heard of Jesus.

## Application

As a Christian, I need to represent Jesus well and share the good news with others. I also pray for more Christians to do the same. Some people may not be open to hearing about Jesus, but I pray that God softens their hearts. The message of the Gospel is about freedom, healing, and comfort for people now, not just avoiding punishment after death.

## Prayer

Lord, please use me to help spread Your message. I want to do my part in Your mission. Please bless my work and make it effective for Your glory. Holy Spirit, please touch the hearts of other believers and inspire them to act. Please help people understand Your message and open their minds and hearts to receive it. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
