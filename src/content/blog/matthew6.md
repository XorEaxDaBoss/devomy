## Scripture

Matthew 6:33: But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
  
## Observation

I am reminded of the importance of seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. It is easy to get caught up in the worries and concerns of this world, but I know that if I prioritize my relationship with God above all else, everything else will fall into place. I trust in His provision and guidance, and I know that as long as I keep my focus on Him, I will be able to navigate any challenge that comes my way.

## Application

My main focus is to prioritize God in my life and stick to the teachings of this scripture. While it can be difficult to consistently remember, I am aware that by doing so, everything else shall fall into its rightful place. The journey requires persistent effort, but the rewards are absolutely worth it.

## Prayer

Dear Lord, I come before you today seeking your guidance and wisdom. Your promise to meet all my needs, as stated in Matthew 6:33, reminds me to always keep you as my top priority. It is my desire to seek your kingdom and righteousness above all else. I trust your plan for my life and have faith that you will lead me in the right direction. Thank you for your unfailing love, grace, and mercy. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
