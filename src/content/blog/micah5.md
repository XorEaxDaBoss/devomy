## Scripture

Micah 5:2: But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.
  

## Observation

Jesus fulfilled many prophecies as the Messiah. He was born in Bethlehem, which is important. This verse shows that the Messiah was always meant to be eternal and pre-existent. This means Jesus has always existed and will always exist. God planned for Jesus to come a long time ago and forever ago.

## Application

Sometimes, it helps to think deeply about a verse like this. Just considering who God is and His eternal nature brings out a desire to worship in me. It's amazing! This verse reminds me that every Christmas song celebrating the birth of my King is really a worship song, honoring the fulfillment of prophecies made thousands of years ago.

## Prayer

Lord, I am grateful for saving me and the grace that continually humbles me. Please help my loved ones see Jesus as the perfect one who fulfilled the prophecies and whose signs are still evident. Enable me to share the gospel truthfully and lovingly so that they may hear with open ears. I pray for Your will to be done. In Jesus's name, Amen.
