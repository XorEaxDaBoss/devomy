## Scripture

  


Micah 5:2: But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.
  

## Observation

Micah speaks of the birthplace of a future ruler over Israel. Despite Bethlehem's small size and insignificance among the clans of Judah, it is to be the birthplace of the One whose origins are from ancient times, indicating His divine nature and eternal existence.

## Application

The selection of Bethlehem as the birthplace of the Messiah highlights God's pattern of choosing the seemingly insignificant and unexpected to accomplish His divine purposes. It shows that God's plans transcend human expectations and that He can use the humblest of places and people for extraordinary purposes.
  
## Prayer

Lord, as the ruler over all creation, we surrender our lives to Your lordship and acknowledge Your divine authority. You are the eternal God, existing from ancient times, and we honor Your divine nature and power. May we find hope and assurance in Your divine rulership and rest in the knowledge of Your eternal existence Amen.
