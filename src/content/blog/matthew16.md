## Scripture

Matthew 16:24: Then Jesus said to his disciples, â€œWhoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.

## Observation

Walking with Jesus requires dedication. Saying no to our own desires means setting them aside and focusing on what God wants. Carrying our cross isn't about jewelry or tattoos. It's about accepting that we might face tough times. This life is short, and we should only value it as much as we use it for God's purpose.

## Application

Honestly, I'm better at facing challenges than saying no to myself. I'm good at giving big things to God, like where to live and work. But in small matters, I struggle with self-control. I make sacrifices for family. But, am I really denying my own wishes to overcome my selfishness and honor God alone?


## Prayer

Lord, I trust You with my life. You know what's best for me and others. I let go of control in big matters for Your plan. Holy Spirit, help me give up small wishes to honor You. Give me strength to follow commands of self-denial. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
