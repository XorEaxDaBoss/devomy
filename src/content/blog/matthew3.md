## Scripture


Matthew 3:8-10: Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
  
## Observation

As Christians, when we give our lives to Jesus, we are forgiven and become His children. But we need to remember that forgiveness is not a one-time event. We must continue to turn away from our mistakes and have a heart of repentance, always receiving His new mercies every day. Just because we are no longer bound by sin doesn't mean we won't make mistakes, but we must strive to behave as God's children should.
  


## Application

Repentance is a choice, but it's also a way of thinking and feeling. I need to accept my mistakes and think about them every day. I need to ask God to show me when and how I did wrong. Then I can ask for forgiveness and try to stop making those mistakes. That's the intentional part. The more immediate part is that when I do something wrong and realize it, I need to be humble and say sorry to God and others. Being humble is part of "keeping with repentance."

## Prayer

Dear God, I'm sorry for my mistakes. Even after you forgave me, I still mess up. Holy Spirit, please guide me and show me where I'm wrong. Help me be humble, but also bold in serving you. I want to live for your glory. In Jesus' name, amen.
