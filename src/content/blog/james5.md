## Scripture

James 5:19-20: My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.

## Observation

In his letter, James warns us not to misuse money and to be patient when we suffer. He also talks about being honest, praying, confessing, and having faith in God. In the last two verses of the book, James emphasizes the importance of combining faith and action, which he talked about earlier in chapter two. James doesn't think we can save others, but we do have a responsibility to help them. Even though James states, “and one turns him back,” we should recognize that it is the individual’s choice to return to the truth and Jesus Christ, which leads to their salvation. But, as Paul also mentions, “How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard?” (Romans 10:14-15). The process of obtaining a saving faith in Jesus Christ is intricate and cannot be simplified. While God alone softens hearts and opens eyes and ears, the Bible reveals that we have a part to play in turning others toward their Creator.

## Application

Sometimes I feel like I have to make people believe in God, but that's not really my job. I just need to speak the truth and be brave about it. I feel drawn to people who already know the gospel but might have stopped believing. This passage encourages me because it shows that even people who already know the truth can still be in danger. I want to help people find their way back to God, but it's not up to me to make them believe. I just need to be prepared to show them the truth.

## Prayer

Lord, Thank you for helping me learn the truth. I appreciate your kindness and patience. You can see people's true feelings, so please help me not assume I know who needs to be saved. Instead, guide me to speak the truth when the Holy Spirit prompts me. I want to be brave and share your message with others, but I know it's not my power that saves them. I'll keep trusting in Jesus and telling my story so others can know Him too. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
