## Scripture

Matthew 7:28-29: When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
  
## Observation

Today's Bible reading includes three chapters of the Sermon on the Mount. It's a long and varied sermon with many important teachings, such as the Beatitudes and the Lord's Prayer. When I read it, I discover something new because it's so full of rich teachings. This time, I was struck by the last two verses and how amazing they are. They're not just clever words or wise sayings, but the very words of God himself. They show us not only what God wants us to do, but also who God is.

## Application

The prophets of old didn't speak by their own authority, including Moses, judges, kings, later prophets, and Pharisees who all inherited their authority. However, Jesus spoke with his own authority. The Bible, which is the written Word of God, speaks directly with God's authority. People don't feel offended or convicted by fortune cookies or Confucius, but they will be offended or convicted wherever the Bible or God is quoted. When I read the red letters, it reminds me that I am reading the words of God. However, I sometimes forget the importance of other parts of the Bible. That's why it's important for me to approach the Bible with the same respect and awe that people felt when they were in the presence of God's direct authority.

## Prayer

Dear Lord, please impress me with Your words and power. Help me to understand and hear Your true message. Let me know that all Your words come straight from You, through the Holy Spirit. I want to respect and honor You more. Please help me to listen to Your teachings and follow Your guidance. Soften my heart so that I can understand Your words clearly, and let Your will be done. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
