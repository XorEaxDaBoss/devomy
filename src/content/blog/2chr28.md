## Scripture

  

2 Chronicles 28:22: In his time of trouble, King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD.

## Observation

Despite facing difficulties and troubles, Ahaz did not turn to the Lord for help and guidance. Instead, he became even more unfaithful, seeking solutions in other gods and engaging in idolatrous practices.


## Application

The verse reminds us of the need for repentance and humility before God. When we find ourselves in difficult situations, rather than turning away from God, we should humble ourselves, confess our sins, and seek His forgiveness and guidance.


  

## Prayer

Lord, We pray for our leaders, that they may seek You and govern with integrity, righteousness, and reliance on Your wisdom. May their decisions bring blessings and prosperity to the people they serve. Forgive us for any unfaithfulness or idolatry in our lives. Help us to repent and turn wholeheartedly to You. Grant us the wisdom and strength to seek Your guidance and trust in Your faithfulness to lead us through challenging times. Amen.
