## Scripture

  

2 Kings 16:2: Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God.

## Observation

Ahaz succeeded his father Jotham as king and ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem. However, unlike King David, his ancestor, Ahaz did not follow the ways of the Lord. He was unfaithful to God and did not do what was right in God's sight.
  


## Application

The verse draws a sharp contrast between King David, known for his devotion to God and righteous rule, and King Ahaz, who chose to forsake the Lord's ways. It highlights the critical role of leadership in shaping the spiritual direction of a nation and the impact it can have on the people.



  

## Prayer

Lord, we pray for godly leadership in our lives and in our nations. Help us to learn from the example of Ahaz and the importance of living righteously. Grant us the wisdom and courage to follow Your commands and seek Your will in all that we do. Amen.
