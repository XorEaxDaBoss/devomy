## Scripture

  

Amos 7:14-15: Amos answered Amaziah, “I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’
  

## Observation

In the Old Testament, there are different categories of books, including the Pentateuch, histories, books of wisdom, major prophets, minor prophets, and the herdsman/grower. It is understandable why some prophets, like Amos, may not have wanted to identify themselves as such, as many were killed for speaking the truth to Israel and Judah. This distinction is important because it shows that a person can fulfill a role without necessarily being that role, and this has always been the case with God. In the New Testament, we learn that prophesying is a gift of the Holy Spirit, and that every disciple of Jesus Christ is blessed with the Holy Spirit. Therefore, anyone can be used by God to prophesy, but not all are necessarily prophets.
  


## Application

I try to remember not to think too highly of myself. While I believe God can use me for great things, it is not because of my own abilities, but because of His greatness. Like Amos, who was called to deliver a specific message, I have a responsibility to complete the tasks God has given me. However, my identity is not defined by these tasks, but rather by my faith in Christ. If I start to define myself by my achievements, I risk becoming arrogant and proud. So, I strive to stay humble and focused on God's plan for me.


  

## Prayer

Lord, You are great, mighty, wise, and strong, attributes that I do not possess. You are omniscient, omnipresent, and sovereign, qualities that are beyond my reach. However, in Jesus Christ, I am found righteous, made holy, and gifted with talents and skills that glorify and honor Your name. I am aware of the dangers of arrogance and pride and the pain they cause. Therefore, I thank You for showing me that Your ways are good and for helping me stay humble. Lord, please help me to remember that my identity is not in what I do but in what I believe. When I put my faith and trust in Jesus Christ, I become Yours, counted as a son of God and an heir. Let me find all of my peace, fulfillment, and satisfaction in You, Lord. In Jesus's name, I pray. Amen.
