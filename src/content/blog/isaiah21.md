## Scripture

  

Isaiah 21:8-9: And the lookout shouted, “Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; every night I stay at my post. Look, here comes a man in a chariot with a team of horses. And he gives back the answer: ‘Babylon has fallen, has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground!’ ”
  

## Observation

Isaiah was given a vision that he described as "dire" in verse 2. Though we don't know the specifics, it's clear that the effects were challenging based on Isaiah's reaction in verses 3-4. Following the vision, Isaiah appointed a lookout to watch for signs indicating that it was coming to pass. When the lookout finally saw something noteworthy, he approached Isaiah with the news by first giving an account of his trustworthy behavior and making it clear that he had been vigilant. It is unclear what prompted this, but the lookout wanted Isaiah to know that he had done an excellent job and offered evidence for why he should be believed. Then, an unnamed person gave an account of Babylon's fall.
  


## Application

Sometimes I find it difficult to understand the messages in short, historical, and limited prophecies. However, I understand the importance of God's omniscience and sovereignty. I also recognize that it is admirable to be trustworthy and reliable in God's eyes. When I keep my word and fulfill my responsibilities, God can use me. This aligns with Colossians 3:23-24, where I have the opportunity to honor God in everything I do. Every decision I make, whether it is related to my work or my interactions with my children, has the potential to bring glory to Him. If I want to be available and useful to God, I need to demonstrate that I am worthy of His calling by prioritizing His glory and honor over my own pleasure and ambition, and by obeying Him with integrity.

  

## Prayer

Lord, Your grace has worked amazingly in me, transforming my motivations and my sense of responsibility. Thank You for making me usable for Your kingdom and Your glory. I admit that I still struggle with my own selfishness and pride. Too often, I prioritize my own will with my time and money or anything else, really. However, I don't want that to be the case. I ask that the Holy Spirit within me would stir every time I'm tempted to pursue my own selfish ambitions. Lord, please correct me anytime I'm tempted to exalt myself above You. I want to be a worthy servant, ready to be used for Your purposes. Please prepare me so that I may be ready when You call upon me to be a watchman, mouthpiece, recorder, shepherd, or anything else You would call me to do. Help me to be trustworthy, able, and ready to do whatever You ask of me. May Your will be done in my life, all for Your glory and honor. I pray all of this in the name of Jesus. Amen.
