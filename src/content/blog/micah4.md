## Scripture

  


Micah 4:6: “In that day,” declares the LORD, “I will gather the lame; I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief.
  

## Observation

God likes to use people who are not proud. There are two reasons for this. First, it is personal because if God uses someone who is humble (either by their own choice or because God has humbled them), they will not become arrogant and think they are better than they really are. This means they will keep seeking a relationship with God instead of leaving Him. Secondly, God uses humble people to show His strength. By using lowly people to do great things, God shows the world how powerful and gracious He is. In this passage, God also includes those who have suffered.

## Application

I want God to use me. But to do that, I need to be humble. I can choose to be humble, or I can let God humble me. Either way, I have to be willing to let God do what's best for me. It's better than being ignored by God (see Hebrews 12:6).

## Prayer

Lord, please use me in whatever way you see fit. I know that serving You is the best way for me to find salvation. Please humble me as necessary. Holy Spirit, guide me according to Your will. Help me to be obedient to You, even when I don't understand why. Bring me closer to You, so that I can glorify Your name and be part of Your people. In Jesus' name, amen.
