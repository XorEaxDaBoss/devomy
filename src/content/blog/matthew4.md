## Scripture

  


Matthew 4:1–4: Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” 
Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
  

## Observation

Jesus is led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
He undergoes a period of fasting for forty days and nights and experiences physical hunger.
The devil approaches Jesus and tempts Him to use His power to turn stones into bread, questioning His identity as the Son of God. Jesus responds by quoting Scripture, specifically Deuteronomy 8:3, emphasizing the importance of relying on God's Word for sustenance.
  


## Application

Jesus' obedience in following the leading of the Spirit into the wilderness teaches us to trust in God's timing and guidance, even when faced with challenges and temptations. We should seek the Holy Spirit's direction in our lives and trust that He will lead us in the right path. Jesus provides an example of how to overcome temptation by relying on the truth of God's Word. Just as Jesus quoted Scripture to combat the devil's temptations, we can find strength and wisdom in God's Word to resist temptation and make righteous choices.



  

## Prayer

Lord, give us the wisdom and strength to overcome temptation by relying on Your Word. Grant us a hunger and thirst for Your truth, and help us to meditate on Your Word daily. May it be a source of guidance, comfort, and conviction in our lives. Protect us from the attacks and doubts of the enemy, and remind us of who we are in You. Strengthen our faith and empower us to live out our purpose as Your children. Amen.
