## Scripture

  


Matthew 4:21-22: Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
  

## Observation

What stood out to me in this passage was that the brothers left their dad. Luke's gospel gives a more detailed timeline, noting that James and John followed Simon Peter and Andrew right after seeing a miraculous catch of fish. Mark's gospel also mentions that their dad had hired helpers. When we combine these accounts, we can see that their decision to follow Jesus wasn't impulsive. We don't know if their dad objected, but he didn't come along. Later, the mom of the brothers approached Jesus, so it's likely she was a follower, but it seems their dad didn't follow Jesus during his time on earth.

## Application

When I choose to follow Jesus, I'm putting Him first in my life. I have to give up my own plans and desires and let Him guide me in everything I do. I need to trust that He knows what's best for me and has a purpose for my life. Following Jesus means I can't rely on myself anymore and I have to seek His guidance in every decision I make. It also means I have to leave behind my old ways and start living a new life in Him. I have to turn away from things that are wrong and let Jesus change me from the inside out to be more like Him.

## Prayer

Lord, you are the perfect father. You never make mistakes and always discipline and teach us. I have been too proud and sometimes don't listen to your teachings. Please forgive me and help me be humble. Correct me when I don't understand your ways. Help me follow you completely and without hesitation. Please be glorified in my life. In Jesus' name, amen.
