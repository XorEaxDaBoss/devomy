## Scripture

  

Amos 4:11: “I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD.
  

## Observation

In this chapter, God recalls various judgments and disciplines that He executed. Each time, He concludes with the same statement, "Yet you have not returned to Me." This emphasizes two crucial points. Firstly, God's heart is for reconciliation, restoration, and redemption, even amidst His righteous justice and perfect judgments. Secondly, it highlights the reality that some people may never repent, no matter how many warnings they receive. This same idea is echoed in Revelation, where severe consequences await those who refuse to turn to God. Amos warned Israel that they were about to face their Maker, but it seems that the warning fell upon deaf ears. Despite all the signs and messages, some hearts remained calloused and unrepentant. It is a reminder that even when faced with harsh consequences, it is up to us to choose whether or not to turn towards God.

## Application

It's amazing to know that God is always willing to forgive us when we repent and turn back to Him. Jesus' sacrifice on the cross has already paid the penalty for our sins, and all we need to do is confess and ask for forgiveness. It's a beautiful thing to experience redemption and reconciliation through Christ. Keeping our hearts soft and open to His love is crucial. We must make sure not to let our hearts become hardened, as it says in Hebrews 3:15. It's such a comforting thought to know that no matter what we've done, God's love and mercy are always available to us.
