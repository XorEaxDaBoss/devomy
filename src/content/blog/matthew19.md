## Scripture

Matthew 18:26: Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

## Observation

I see Jesus talking to people. He's saying that for humans, some things are really hard to do, almost like they can't be done. But he's also saying that with God, there's nothing that can't be done. So, it's like he's giving hope that even when things seem super tough, God can make them possible."

## Application

I should know my limits, but I must never limit God's power. Jesus said it applies to everything, not just one thing. I've seen miracles in my life, some impressive. But I haven't seen Matthew-like miracles. That's why reading the Bible daily is important. My faith isn't just from my stories, but from those of people long ago, talking about the same powerful God in the Bible (2 Timothy 3:16).


## Prayer

Lord, I can't do everything alone, but with You, everything is possible. There are challenges in my life now that I can't handle on my own. I might have ideas, but I understand it could be beyond my capabilities. Help me, God. Your Word and Your Son assure us that all things are possible with You. Bring miracles where I'm stuck. Let God's power and love shine and bring glory to Your name. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
