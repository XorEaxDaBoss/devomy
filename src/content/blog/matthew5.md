title: Matthew Chapter 5
description: In Matthew 5:27-28, Jesus teaches that even if a person does not commit adultery physically, they can still be guilty of it in their heart if they lust after someone who is not their spouse. This emphasizes the importance of controlling one's thoughts and desires, not just their actions.

## Scripture

  


Matthew 5:27-28: “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
  

## Observation

Firstly, being pure isn't just about sexual stuff. Jesus is talking straight to the heart with this message. Being pure starts from the inside, with how you feel. It's okay to appreciate beauty, but it's not okay to stare, imagine things, or do anything like that. It's important to remember that the physical consequences might not be the same, but the spiritual effects can be just as bad for cheating in your heart as it is for cheating in real life.  

## Application

God wants us to have pure thoughts and keep our bodies pure too. We can do this by thinking good thoughts, avoiding things that make us want to do wrong, and being kind to others. We also need to be smart and avoid things that might make us want to do wrong.

## Prayer

Lord, please forgive me for my sins. Holy Spirit, please help me remember this verse whenever I am tempted. Please guide me to focus on this verse so that it remains in my heart and mind. Thank you for helping me see the importance of purity. Please help me to act with honesty, integrity, and a pure heart. I pray all of this in the name of Jesus. Amen.
