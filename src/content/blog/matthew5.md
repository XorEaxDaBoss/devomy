## Scripture

  


Matthew 5:16: In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
  

## Observation

Jesus encourages His followers to let their light shine before others. The purpose of shining our light is to demonstrate good deeds to those around us. The ultimate goal is to bring glory to our Father in heaven.
  


## Application

Our good deeds should not be done to bring attention to ourselves, but rather to bring glory to our Father in heaven. We should strive to be humble and selfless, acknowledging that any good we do is a result of God's grace and power working through us. Our words and actions should align with our faith and point others to the goodness of God.



  

## Prayer

Lord, Guide us to demonstrate good deeds that reflect Your character. Give us opportunities to make a positive impact in the lives of those around us, bringing hope, comfort, and encouragement. May our actions be a testament to Your goodness and draw others closer to You. Amen.
