## Scripture

Matthew 8:23-27: Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!” He replied, “You of little faith, why are you so afraid?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!”
  
## Observation

This story has some important points. One big point is that Jesus didn't scold the disciples for waking him up during the storm. He didn't say they were being too dramatic or mistaken. The storm was very tough, but they were all protected because Jesus was with them. How you ask for help matters. If they had asked Jesus nicely, He might have responded differently.

## Application

Jesus didn't promise an easy life when we follow Him. He warned that there will be dangers and hard times. But, is it really dangerous to follow Jesus when He keeps us safe? Even if we have to suffer for Him, it's not really dangerous because we will never truly die. We don't need to be scared when we follow Jesus because He always triumphs. During tough times, we can take comfort in our faith and belief in Jesus. We must remember that our goodness comes from the kindness of God, and there is no reason to be afraid.

## Prayer

Lord, Thank You for Your kindness and love that makes me one of your children. I feel blessed to know that I don't have to be afraid of anything. Although sometimes I feel scared, I ask for Your forgiveness. Please help me to trust You more and have faith in every situation. I know You are with me, so no one can harm me. I know You are on my side, so I have nothing to fear. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
