## Scripture

Matthew 14:30: But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”

## Observation

This verse can be understood in a couple of ways. Firstly, when Simon Peter stopped focusing on Jesus, his faith wavered, and he struggled. Another perspective is that Peter's faith weakened a bit even as he experienced the miracle. Instead of giving up and returning to the boat (which he could have done as a fisherman), he called for Jesus. This makes me think: did they both walk on the waves back to the boat after Peter held Jesus' hand?

## Application

I can believe in big things thanks to the gift of faith. I've even seen amazing miracles. It's not about me being special, but God giving me extra belief—still a gift, though smaller compared to Simon Peter's. But sometimes, I struggle with specific beliefs. It's that moment between "God can" and "God will." When that happens, I must ask the Lord for help, to make my faith stronger and keep me above the waves with Him.


## Prayer

Lord, thank You for the faith to believe big things. But I struggle with doubts sometimes. Please help me, Lord. Holy Spirit, make my faith stronger as God wants. When things get tough, hold my hand and lift me up. Show me Your great power to save. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
