## Scripture

Isaiah 23:17: At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her lucrative prostitution and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
  
## Observation

The book of Isaiah contains a prophecy directed towards Tyre, a city known for its power and wickedness in the world of trade. The punishment is severe, and the loss of their trading partner is mourned by many nations. The city is completely destroyed, with no mention of any survivors. The prophecy speaks of God's wrath being executed against Tyre, with words like "destroyed" and "no more." However, in verses 15-18, it is revealed that the destruction of Tyre would only last for seventy years. It is surprising to note that after this period, the city continued on as if nothing had happened, with little effect on its operations. The prophecy serves as a warning about the dangers of corruption and the temporary nature of worldly power.

## Application

There are some kingdoms and cities that God chose to destroy forever, while with others, He seems to have lifted His hand from being against them. The reasons a kingdom or city received a particular judgment may remain a mystery forever. The Bible doesn't disclose details on why God chose Tyre for a temporary destruction, but it's essential to remember this prophecy because it reminds us of a few important principles. First, God is sovereign in His will. He may choose one for eternal destruction and another for a less permanent end, and that is His right as the Maker of all things. Second, this prophecy reminds us that God is not surprised, and He knew what He was doing from the outset. Last, it reminds us that evil will continue to exist until the final day of the Lord when Jesus returns to remake the heavens and the earth.

It's crucial to understand that punishing evil people and vindicating the victims will not solve the problem of sin. At best, it delays the inevitable. Evil will continue to rear its ugly head until the return of Jesus Christ, either as Redeemer or as Judge. Therefore, when we see atrocities, we should still pray that God's justice is done according to His will, but we cannot make the mistake of thinking that destroying wicked people will solve the problem of evil. The ultimate solution to the problem of sin can only be found in Jesus Christ.

  

## Prayer

Lord, I come before You with a heart full of humility and trust. I believe that You are the Almighty and that Your plans are perfect. I pray that Your will be done in every aspect of my life. Please grant me the patience to wait for Your righteous judgments. Please continue to soften my heart so that I may pray for the salvation of those who are lost instead of their destruction. I ask that when You pour out Your perfect judgment, many will be saved. Whenever I see evil in the world, let my first response be to pray for the redemption of the wicked and for them to be used for Your glory, but only according to Your will. In the mighty name of Jesus, I pray. Amen.
