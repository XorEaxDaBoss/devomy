## Scripture

  

Genesis 6:5–8: The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. So the LORD said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.” But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
  

## Observation

The passage describes the wickedness and corruption that had overtaken humanity during this time. God's response to the state of humanity was one of sorrow, regret, and deep concern. Despite the impending judgment, Noah is singled out as a righteous man who found favor in God's eyes.

  


## Application

Noah's righteousness and favor with God offer encouragement and inspiration. We are reminded of the importance of living a life that pleases God, seeking His favor through obedience, faith, and righteousness. He also stood out amidst a wicked generation. Similarly, we are called to be lights in the midst of darkness, living out our faith and sharing God's love and truth with others.



  

## Prayer

Lord, my desire is to serve you, but my sinful nature would have me go totally contrary to that.  Help me, guide me to Your will and not my own, and show me when my desires are in conflict with Yours so that I may turn to You.  In Jesus' name, Amen.
