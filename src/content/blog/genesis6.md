## Scripture

  

Genesis 6:5–8: The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. So the LORD said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.” But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
  

## Observation

In the story of the flood, we gain insight into God's character. He reveals that He experiences regret, not because He was caught off guard or lacked understanding, but because of His unrequited love for us. Despite knowing that we would fail to love Him back, He still chose to create us and love us unconditionally. The pain of that one-way love is something we can never fully comprehend, but the weight and severity of His sorrow over it is plainly seen in the flood.

  


## Application

Many people claim to live without regrets, even Christians who attribute their past mistakes to finding Christ. However, I believe this mindset is both foolish and arrogant. If God can experience regret, then surely we, as mere mortals, can as well. Although God never makes mistakes, He regretted creating mankind on earth. Therefore, it's acceptable to feel remorse for our mistakes and even for making the right choices that have caused others pain. Acknowledging regret means recognizing that we would make different choices if we had the chance. Some people think that if things had played out differently, they wouldn't have found salvation. This may be true, but it's important to accept the grief caused by our actions and choices. The key is to react appropriately to that grief. God took perfect action in response to His regret, and we can do the same. Through prayer and reflection, we can admit our mistakes and express regret in a healthy way. It's crucial to avoid wallowing in regret, which can be damaging, just as feeding anger can be. Instead, we should address our regrets in a constructive manner.


  

## Prayer

Lord, I believe that You are perfect in character. Thank You for providing us with so much wisdom on how to handle our emotions. I appreciate that You understand all of the emotions that I experience, including adoration, anger, longing, pain, jealousy, and regret. Please guide me in responding to and managing my emotions in the same way that You do. Help me to act in a way that honors Your name and follows Your will. I pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen.
