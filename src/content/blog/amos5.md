## Scripture

  

Amos 5:24: But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!
  

## Observation

Amos calls the people of Israel to pursue justice and righteousness. He emphasizes the importance of these qualities, using the vivid imagery of a rolling river and a never-failing stream. This verse reflects God's desire for His people to live justly and righteously, walking in obedience to His commands.

  


## Application

Amos' message reminds us of the significance of seeking justice in our society and personal lives. As God's children, we are called to stand up for the oppressed, defend the vulnerable, and promote fairness in all aspects of life. We are to be agents of change and strive to make a positive impact on the lives of others.



  

## Prayer

Lord, we lift up our broken world before You, where injustice, oppression, and inequality abound. We pray for the marginalized, the oppressed, and the vulnerable. May Your justice roll on like a river, bringing relief and hope to those who are suffering. Grant us the courage to stand up for those who are oppressed and to be advocates for change. May we never grow weary in doing what is right, knowing that Your truth and love will prevail. Amen.
